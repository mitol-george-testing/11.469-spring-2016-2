Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _11.469 Urban Sociology in Theory and Practice_ as it was taught by Assistant Professor Justin Steil and Teaching Assistant Aditi Mehta in Spring 2016.

This course introduces students to core writings in the field of urban sociology, and explores the nature and changing character of the city and the urban experience in the U.S. and abroad. Topics include the changing conceptions of “community,” the effects of neighborhood characteristics on individual outcomes, the significance of social capital and networks, the drivers of categorical inequality, and the interaction of social structure and political power. This class is comprised of students from MIT and from the [Boston University Metropolitan College Prison Education Program](http://sites.bu.edu/pep/), and took place at the [Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Norfolk](http://www.mass.gov/eopss/law-enforce-and-cj/prisons/doc-facilities/mci-norfolk.html).

Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

The course has two primary goals:

1.  To give students a more critical appreciation of the contemporary, comparative, and historical contexts in which planning skills and sensibilities have been developed and are applied.
2.  To offer a “sociology of knowledge” approach to the field of urban sociology.

Instructor Insights

{{< quote "The material in this course was challenging and the workload demanding.  We did not see a difference in the capabilities or dedication of MIT and BU students.  In classroom discussions, both groups of students shined.  Because the MIT grad students had more practice writing, we spent more time editing BU papers, but the analysis, arguments, and thoughts were equally impressive among both groups.  The experience reinforced the idea that everyone is capable of learning and contributing successfully if given the right opportunities."

The Classroom
-------------

Seminars took place in the Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Norfolk with half of the class from MIT and half of the class from MCI Norfolk. The location and composition of the class was chosen based on the belief that bringing together students of sociology and urban studies who are incarcerated with those who are at MIT will create a unique and valuable environment in which to generate new knowledge about our social world and the repeated mechanisms that contribute to persistent socio-economic inequality and other pressing social problems. Participation in the course involved a commitment to a new type of learning environment.
